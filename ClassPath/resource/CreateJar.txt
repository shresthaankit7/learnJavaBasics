Setting an Entry Point with the JAR Tool

The 'e' flag (for 'entrypoint') creates or overrides the manifest's Main-Class attribute. It can be used while creating or updating a JAR file. Use it to specify the application entry point without editing or creating the manifest file.
For example, this command creates app.jar where the Main-Class attribute value in the manifest is set to MyApp:

jar cfe app.jar MyApp MyApp.class

You can directly invoke this application by running the following command:

java -jar app.jar

If the entrypoint class name is in a package it may use a '.' (dot) character as the delimiter. For example, if Main.class is in a package called foo the entry point can be specified in the following ways:

jar cfe Main.jar foo.Main foo/Main.class
